This recommender model implements a movie recommender system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and historical ratings. This system utilizes Machine Learning and NLP algorithms to achieve accurate and personalized recommendations.

## Features

* Recommends movies to users based on their ratings or other user data (if used).
* Provides functionalities like:
  * User-based recommendations: Recommending movies similar to those liked by similar users.

Data preprocessing is one of the critical steps in any machine learning project. It includes cleaning and formatting the data before feeding into a machine learning algorithm. For NLP, the preprocessing steps are comprised of the following tasks :

1. Tokenizing the string
2. Lowercasing
3. Removing stop words and punctuation
4. Stemming
5. Sequential modelling
